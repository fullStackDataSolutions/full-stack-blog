**‚ÄúCustomers will never love a company until the employees love it first.‚Äù** - [Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com)  

In the fast-paced world of tech, companies often prioritize shareholders above all else, focusing on short-term profits and quarterly earnings. But this approach comes at a cost‚Äîburnt-out employees, dissatisfied customers, and a business that struggles to sustain its success.  

Here‚Äôs the truth: shareholders don‚Äôt create value. Customers do, and employees make it happen. Without happy customers funding the company and engaged employees driving innovation, shareholder returns will ultimately dwindle.  

Tech leaders must rethink their priorities. The companies that thrive in the long run are the ones that put people‚Äîemployees and customers‚Äîfirst. Shareholders will always make plenty of money when the foundation of the business is strong.

## **The Problem With Shareholder-First Thinking in Tech**

### Shareholders Don't Fund the Company‚ÄîCustomers Do  
A common misconception in business is that shareholders are the ones funding companies. While shareholders may provide initial investments, the real engine of a business is its customers. Without customers purchasing products or services, there is no revenue, and the company ceases to exist.  

Likewise, employees are the ones creating the value that customers pay for. They are the innovators, the builders, and the problem-solvers. Yet, in many companies, employees are treated as costs to be minimized rather than assets to be invested in.  

On the other hand, shareholders are passive participants. They benefit from the value created by employees and customers but play no direct role in the company‚Äôs day-to-day success. When businesses put shareholders first, they alienate the very people‚Äîemployees and customers‚Äîwho make the business possible.

### The Downward Spiral of Profit-Over-People Thinking  
When companies focus on maximizing short-term profits at the expense of employees and customers, they enter a dangerous cycle:  

1. **Lower Customer Satisfaction**: Cutting corners on product quality, customer support, or user experience may save money in the short term, but it drives customers away in the long run.  
2. **Employee Burnout and Turnover**: Overworking employees or underpaying them leads to high attrition rates, which increases hiring costs and reduces productivity.  
3. **Reputation Damage**: Customers and employees talk. Poor treatment spreads quickly, damaging the company‚Äôs reputation and making it harder to attract customers and talent.  
4. **Declining Profits**: As customers leave and employee engagement drops, revenue falls, pushing leadership to cut costs further‚Äîand the spiral continues.  

üí° **Fact**: According to [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/cost-employee-turnover.aspx), replacing an employee can cost up to 33% of their annual salary, making high turnover incredibly expensive.  

This approach is not only unsustainable‚Äîit‚Äôs a recipe for failure.

## **Why Prioritizing Employees and Customers Works**

### 1. Employee Satisfaction Drives Tech Innovation  
Innovation is the lifeblood of the tech industry, and it comes from empowered, motivated employees. Companies that treat their workers well see greater productivity, creativity, and loyalty.  

**Case Study: Google**  
Google has long been celebrated for its employee-first culture. By offering perks like flexible work schedules, professional development opportunities, and mental health programs, Google creates an environment where employees can thrive. As a result, the company consistently ranks as one of the most innovative in the world.  

üí° **Fact**: A 2022 [Gallup study](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/393497/employee-engagement-slump-continues.aspx) found that highly engaged employees are 23% more productive and contribute to 21% higher profitability.

### 2. A Customer-First Approach Builds Loyalty  
A customer-first approach creates loyalty and trust, which are critical for sustainable growth. When customers feel valued, they return, recommend your product to others, and stick with your brand even when competitors offer alternatives.  

**Case Study: Amazon**  
Amazon‚Äôs obsession with customer satisfaction is a key driver of its success. From fast delivery to an easy returns process, Amazon prioritizes customer convenience at every step. This focus has helped Amazon grow into a trillion-dollar company while maintaining customer loyalty.  

üí° **Fact**: A 2023 [Deloitte report](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/customer-experience/customer-experience-strategy.html) found that companies with a strong focus on customer experience outperform their competitors by 80% in revenue growth.

### 3. Shareholder Returns Follow Naturally  
When employees and customers thrive, shareholders benefit too. Companies that invest in people see stronger financial performance, greater resilience in tough markets, and a higher likelihood of long-term success.  

**Case Study: Salesforce**  
Salesforce embraces a stakeholder-first approach through its "Ohana" culture, treating employees, customers, and communities as family. This focus has led to high employee retention, top-notch customer satisfaction, and consistently high revenue growth.  

üí° **Fact**: Salesforce‚Äôs stock price has grown over 700% in the past decade, according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/), proving that putting people first is a winning strategy for shareholders.
